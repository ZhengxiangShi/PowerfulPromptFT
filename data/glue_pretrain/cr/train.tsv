this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .	1
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .	1
let the champ win you over ! .	1

the blue backlight is pretty cool .	1
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .	1
the interface is simple to use .	1
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .	1
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .	1
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .	1
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .	0
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .	1
t-mobile was a pretty good server .	1
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .	1
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .	1
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .	1
the features are really cool like the radio .	1
it is a nice router in all ways but one .	1
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	1
enjoy .	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .	1
moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .	1
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	0
especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .	0
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
it was also the most appealing .	1
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .	0

it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .	0

it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .	0

pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .	1
the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp .	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .	1
further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .	1
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .	1
the in ital setup of the router was simple .	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .	1
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
- outstanding signal reception	1
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .	1
as for bluetooth , no problems at all .	1
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .	1
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .	1
5 . the price is right .	1
the i-pod is the best thing i have ever used .	1
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .	1
for the price i don 't think you can beat it .	1
it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .	1
6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .	1
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .	1
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .	1
all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .	1
"the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless ."	1
the diaper champ is the best ! .	1
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .	1
this really is a great little phone ; . its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! .	1
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .	1
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .	1
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back ) .	0
as a loyal customer of norton/symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) .	0
this makes for a great phone .	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .	1
on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tone ( usually a major city ) .	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .	1
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .	1
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .	0
"otherwise , this is a great "" alternative "" mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple ."	1
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .	1
works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia .	1
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .	1
i never get dropped calls .	1
booting up my computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	0
"if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $105 . 50 per minute and blame you for "" abusing "" your ipod ."	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	1
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .	1
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones .	0
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .	1
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .	1
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .	1
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .	1
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .	1
it 's faster than wmp .	1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool .	1
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .	1
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .	1
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .	1
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .	1
the only problem is the battery life .	0
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .	1
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .	0
i prefer things that are simple .	1
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .	1
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts .	0
this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .	1
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .	1
8 battery life is excellent .	1
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .	1
"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . ."	1
very simple and painless .	1
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .	1
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge .	1
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .	1
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .	1
pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options	1
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98 .	1
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .	1
the earbud headphones are really nice .	1
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .	1
the router works fine for both wired and wireless .	1
just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .	0
overall , this product is awesome .	1
good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy	1
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .	1
- excellent sound quality	1
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .	1
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .	1
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .	1
seriously ! . i love it ! .	1
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .	0
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .	1
"decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 """	1
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .	0
bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .	1
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
the sound is very nice .	1
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid .	1
this phone has many other features , ir , ; . just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .	1
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .	1
it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .	1
upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .	1
the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .	0
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .	1
great phone . . .	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .	1
works great ! . ! . ! . ! .	1
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky .	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .	1
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .	1
"i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required "" permissions "" and lacked proper administrator status ."	0
this phone is fantastic .	1
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .	1
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee .	1
i love this phone .	1
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .	1
also , with one click you can help train your spam killer .	1
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .	0
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
it has plenty of power .	1
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .	1
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .	1
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .	0
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .	1
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .	1
the phone is very light weight .	1
and the battery life is bad ! .	0
- well-backlit keypad	1
the phone itself is pretty nice .	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .	1
"i could take 1/2 "" passes and it still didn 't skip a beat ."	1
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .	1
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .	1
flawless .	1
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .	1
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .	1
i think the interface is great .	1
"we constantly got "" windows virtual memory low "" error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes ."	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .	1
this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .	1
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .	1
it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .	1
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .	1
"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "" handle "" and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails ."	0
i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .	1
great phone , i 'd buy another .	1
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	1
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html	1
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now .	1
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .	0
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .	1
a bit disappoint on that ! .	0
it 's good .	1
the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .	1
this is a great product ! .	1
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .	1
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .	0
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .	0
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .	1
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .	1
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .	1
if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .	1
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .	0
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .	1
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .	1
"from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to "" cc app . exe "" program running which is a norton program ."	0
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .	1
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .	1
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . .	1
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .	0
the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .	1
this is really a no brain er .	1
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .	1
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
i love the performance and features of this router .	1
the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .	1
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	1
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .	1
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .	0
"while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with "" alerts "" every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off ."	0
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .	0
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .	0
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .	1
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .	0
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
it 's oval and . . . nice .	1
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .	1
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .	1
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .	1
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .	0
very sturdy and strong .	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year .	1
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .	1
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
5 . the camera installed on this phone is awesome .	1
the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking .	1
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .	1
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .	1
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .	1
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .	1
you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .	1
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .	0
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .	1
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .	1
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .	1
the ! . sound quality is great .	1
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .	1
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .	0
there is no odor and it is very easy to use .	1
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .	1
i purchased two of these beauties .	1
it feels tiny in the hand without it .	1
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .	0
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will .	1
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .	1
bottom line great phone for the time being .	1
"the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that "" creative "" branding is all over the place within it ."	1
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .	1
plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no problem .	1
it was a symantec error .	0
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .	1
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; . it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .	1
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .	1
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .	1
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .	1
"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead ."	0
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .	1
the extra gb is just a bonus .	1
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .	1
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .	1
"i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the "" mixed mode "" feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router ."	1
battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .	0
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	0
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .	1
"about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to "" hip "" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the "" awkward "" factor ."	1
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .	1
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .	1
if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .	1
but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .	1
my experience with installation was quite good .	1
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .	1
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .	1
after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .	1
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .	0
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .	1
the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .	1
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .	1
the vibrate setting is loud ! .	0
their site offers no live help at all .	0
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .	1
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .	1
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
the zen micro is near perfect .	1
"20 gb or 40 gb ? . the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a "" dock station "" and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ) ."	1
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .	1
they 're easy to use .	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
best phone i 've ever owned , period .	1
once you set it up , it 's great .	1
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly .	1
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .	1
"i recently had to run a 3/4 "" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down ."	1
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .	0
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .	1
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .	1
2 ) the champ uses regular store bags .	1
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .	0
dependability : i 've seen no glitches .	1
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .	1
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .	0
i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell ! .	1
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .	1
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .	1
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .	1
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .	1
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
i have never had an odor problem ! .	1
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .	1
the interface took a little getting used to .	0
( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag .	1
it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot .	1
you can use it as a storage hard drive .	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance .	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .	1
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .	1
the hard case they give with it must work well .	1
white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .	1
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .	1
its quiet .	0
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .	1
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? .	1
) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .	1
another 5 star performance .	1
the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color .	1
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	1
all in all i am pleased with the router .	1
"seems the "" program scan "" feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! ."	0
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .	1
"also included in the "" games "" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs ."	1
you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .	0
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	0
i love the slim design ; . the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .	1
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .	0
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .	1
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .	1
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .	1
. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	1
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .	1
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .	0
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router .	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .	1
picture and video quality is ok .	1
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online .	0
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .	1
pros : large hard drive for the $$ -- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable .	1
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .	1
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .	1
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .	1
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .	1
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast .	1
the champ works great .	1
and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags -- -this takes ordinary garbage bags ! .	1
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system ! .	0
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .	1
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .	1
it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options .	1
i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt . com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps/directions into it , which is great .	1
thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .	1
versatile and stylish .	1
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .	1
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support .	0
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
next , the big reason not to buy any norton product : if there 's a problem with it , norton charges $30 to even tell them about it .	0
3 . play java games on it .	1
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .	1
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .	1
also , not liking the gel case .	0
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .	0
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	0
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .	1
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
: ! . ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool .	1
the setup was very easy .	1
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues .	0
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .	1
pc cable is too expensive . . . $ 50 for a usb cable ? .	0
i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! .	1
way to go apple ! .	1
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .	1
track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .	1
it is quiet and has plenty of power .	1
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .	1
the soft start is nice .	1
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .	0
the setup software did everything .	1
reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .	1
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .	1
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .	1
who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95 ? . ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .	0
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .	1
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .	0
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .	1
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .	1
- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma . . . and yeah , wav too .	1
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server .	1
the user support service isn 't too great either .	0
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .	1
i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .	1
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .	1
if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else .	1
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .	1
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .	1
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .	0
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .	1
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .	0
on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .	1
the biggest problem is the installation .	0
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )	1
only if we could get one camera in it . .	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .	1
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .	1
the phone is sturdy .	1
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
the battery life is amazing .	1
sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .	1
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish .	1
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .	1
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .	1
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .	1
it works great .	1
comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .	1
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .	1
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .	1
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .	0
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .	1
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	1
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault .	0
so , don 't buy this or upgrade .	0
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .	1
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .	1
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .	1
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .	1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .	1
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .	1
it has great incredibility .	1
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .	1
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .	1
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .	1
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable .	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	1
but this camera is great ! .	1
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .	1
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	0
"i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "" diaper "" trash bags necessary ."	1
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .	1
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .	0
"we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party "" asking "" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks ."	0
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! . ! . ! .	1
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .	0
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .	1
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .	1
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .	1
7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .	1
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
the product i rate five stars ,	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .	1
one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .	1
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .	1
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .	1
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .	1
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well .	1
"there 's even an equalizer ( under "" settings "" ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , "" deep "" , and electronic ."	1
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .	1
this product is absolutely not ready for release .	0
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	1
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .	1
but , for the money it is a good machine .	1
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .	0
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .	1
they didn 't know what the problem could be .	0
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .	1
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .	0
this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start-up from 4 down to 2 .	1
cons breaks easily .	0
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .	1
1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .	0
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia .	1
i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .	1
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .	1
i have the black one and adore it .	1
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
this model appears to be especially good .	1
setup in xp was instant and intuitive .	1
it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .	1
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and real media video clips .	1
for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .	1
only then did i learn the truth -- this phone does not work with palm pdas ! .	0
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
record memos using the built in microphone .	1
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .	0
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	0
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .	1
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
all at the same time , and all without a hitch .	1
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .	0
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
this product has virtually all the same installation problems .	0
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .	0
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	1
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around .	1
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal .	1
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .	0
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .	1
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com	1
"5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "" free picture and video messaging "" offered by service provider ."	0
it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .	1
i must have gotten a good one .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity .	1
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call .	1
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .	1
itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .	1
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 ! .	1
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .	1
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker .	1
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .	1
a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .	1
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! . ! . ! .	1
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .	1
the fm radio is cool .	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .	1
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .	1
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car , for example .	0
great camera .	1
i 've had no problems w/ this phone .	1
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .	1
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .	1
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .	0
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .	1
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .	0
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .	1
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .	1
the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .	1
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .	1
no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient	0
this is the best phone i have seen .	1
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
i am bored with the silver look .	0
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .	1
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	1
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	1
it would not hang up on calls .	0
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .	1
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .	0
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .	0
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .	1
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .	0
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .	1
"i have only used it with the 1/4 "" collet and a 1/2 "" round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly ."	1
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .	0
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well . . . when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .	1
this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .	1
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .	1
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support . . . . they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .	0
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .	1
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .	0
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .	0
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .	1
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .	1
- some features in the user interface	0
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .	1
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .	0
this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .	1
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .	1
overall , i highly recommend this phone .	1
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )	1
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .	1
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .	0
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates .	0
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .	0
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .	1
this product is a lifesaver ! . ! .	1
 	1
the battery has a long life .	1
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .	0
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .	1
it 's so small .	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	0
i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .	0
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .	1
overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .	1
really happy with this little camera .	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .	1
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."	0
not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .	1
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .	1
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .	1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	1
long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod ! .	1
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .	1
) one outstanding positive feature is the battery . it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup .	1
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .	1
( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! .	1
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
great screen and great sound .	1
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .	0
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .	1
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .	1
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	0
this thing does everything but washes your dishes .	1
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .	0
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one .	0
"for a sleeker , smaller and more "" average "" mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful ."	1
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .	1
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . '	1
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	1
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .	1
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .	0
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .	1
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .	1
very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .	1
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .	1
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .	1
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .	1
the quality is superb .	1
other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .	1
with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .	1
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .	1
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! . ! . ! . ! . i love this phone ! . ! . ! .	1
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .	1
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .	0
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .	1
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .	1
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .	1
the only problem is the size of the keys .	0
the sound is amazing .	1
the service from t-mobile is very good too .	1
i am glad that i do not work for norton .	0
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .	0
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .	1
ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .	1
i highly recommend this phone .	1
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .	1
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .	1
in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .	0
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .	1
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	1
"if you have an older version of "" internet security "" installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install ."	0
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .	1
*holds the odor in nicely ! .	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .	1
and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan .	1
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .	1
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .	1
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa .	1
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .	1
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .	1
no down time , great signal strength .	1
great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) ; . and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .	1
battery : a big big plus .	1
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .	1
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .	1
i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use .	1
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .	1
i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .	1
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210	1
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
the accessories that come with the player are great .	1
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .	1
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .	1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .	1
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
photos are pretty darned good ! .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
and really this is the best phone one could have .	1
the phones are awesome .	1
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .	1
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .	1
they take excellent macro shots as well .	1
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
5 . check traffic411 . com for la traffic on the 405 .	1
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	0
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking	0
they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .	1
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .	1
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .	1
in my table the m12v has been a real champ .	1
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .	1
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .	0
and we still love it ! .	1
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .	1
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .	1
don 't worry this player rocks .	1
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .	1
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did .	1
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .	1
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a pda .	1
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .	1
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
i mean , they 're short ! .	0
works pretty well .	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	0
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
excellent sound i mean the player has juice .	1
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .	1
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	1
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together .	1
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .	1
the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it .	0
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .	1
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .	1
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners .	0
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .	1
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .	1
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .	1
this is a well-made and powerful tool .	1
"getting the router setup in a "" vanilla "" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem ."	1
yes , the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem .	1
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .	1
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .	1
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .	1
also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .	1
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	0
among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .	1
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .	1
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .	1
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
"that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the "" add to cart "" button already ! ."	1
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .	1
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .	1
using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .	1
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .	1
"while i have not had the "" privilege "" , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones ."	1
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .	1
it looks sleek and modern .	1
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .	1
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .	1
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .	1
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .	0
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )	1
"the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "" what diaper smell "" in less time than that ."	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .	1
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .	1
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .	1
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever .	1
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .	1
"some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "" the bar of soap "" which , it really is ."	0
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .	1
ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .	1
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .	1
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .	0
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .	0
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! . ! . ! .	1
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .	1
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .	1
anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .	1
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
"my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of "" brick . "" *"	0
the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .	1
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .	1
drops and strong signals even from the backyard .	1
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .	1
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .	1
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .	1
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! . shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" ."	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .	1
im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )	1
the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .	1
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :	0
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .	1
best in class .	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .	1
the player is great .	1
t610 supports only midi files .	0
i absolutely love it .	1
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .	1
also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything .	1
when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .	1
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )	1
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; . they look as though they were built out of lego's .	0
this is one of the best purchases we made .	1
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .	0
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .	1
7 picture quality is excellent .	1
compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .	1
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .	1
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
it holds plenty of songs .	1
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .	1
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .	0
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .	0
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .	1
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	1
"the sound is great , the portability , etc . . . all the "" stuff "" you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it ."	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
it has it all .	1
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .	1
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ) .	1
this is an excellent router for the money .	1
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .	0
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .	0
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .	1
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .	0
( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .	1
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far .	1
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .	0
transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .	1
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .	1
incredible memory ! .	1
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .	1
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .	1
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .	0
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .	1
these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .	1
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
"the card basically installed itself and the "" install wizard "" on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) ."	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .	1
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .	1
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .	0
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .	1
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days .	1
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .	1
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .	1
i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .	1
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .	1
goes ~3 days after a charge .	1
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	1
the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .	1
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .	1
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .	1
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .	1
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .	1
the battery is removable .	1
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy .	1
but the product is elf is great .	1
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly .	1
for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate .	1
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
poor visibility on the keys .	0
there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .	1
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .	1
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .	1
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .	1
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .	1
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .	1
user interface : the software is simple and straight forward .	1
i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .	0
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .	1
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .	1
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .	1
upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .	1
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .	1
 	1
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .	1
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .	0
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .	1
i have an ipod and it is a great buy .	1
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .	1
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .	1
everything shines of quality .	1
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .	1
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	0
all in all , this is a great phone .	1
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .	0
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .	1
i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .	1
i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it .	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .	1
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .	1
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .	1
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .	1
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .	1
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .	1
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .	1
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .	1
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .	0
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .	0
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
downside : it takes a long time to start up .	0
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .	1
- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .	1
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .	1
1 ) the champ is easy to use .	1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .	1
both the on/off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand .	1
all of this said [as it 's on it 's way back to amazon] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .	1
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .	1
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
just point and shoot and the photos were great .	1
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .	1
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .	0
the player is smaller than you think .	1
the menu is easy to use and understand .	1
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc .	1
this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .	1
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .	1
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! . ) .	1
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .	1
no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .	1
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .	0
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .	0
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .	1
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .	1
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .	1
likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .	1
*	0
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .	1
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .	1
"their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the "" programs "" directory ."	1
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .	1
cons : no am/fm radio tuner -- something a large number of compete tors are doing	0
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .	0
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .	1
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .	1
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .	1
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .	1
this phone is a winner . . .	1
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .	1
5 stars all the way ! .	1
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .	1
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! . ! .	1
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .	0
few month ago , it 's very popular among my community .	1
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .	1
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .	0
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .	1
seems to work great .	1
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .	1
it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .	1
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
really easy to use .	1
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
the great and versatile ipod	1
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .	0
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .	1
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .	1
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .	0
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .	1
i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ) .	1
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .	1
i like the size and shape .	1
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .	0
"the "" movies "" last about 5 seconds ."	0
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .	1
the zen offered a great alternative .	1
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .	1
it works easily with one hand , which is important .	1
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .	1
the pop up blocker and anti-spam are bonuses .	1
overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th ! .	1
the sound is just fine .	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .	1
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .	1
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .	1
love the speaker phone .	1
the battery life on this phone is surreal .	1
give each friend a different ringtone .	1
it is crystal clear .	1
all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .	1
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .	0
the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .	1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .	1
- replaceable battery .	1
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other niceties , that you would enjoy .	1
i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .	1
strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .	0
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge .	1
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .	1
battery life is ok .	1
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with .	1
nokia does not disappoint in this model .	1
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .	0
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .	1
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .	1
i have had no problems with the phone .	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	1
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	0
it definitely keeps the smell out .	1
anti-spam is good	1
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .	1
this is a wonderful camera .	1
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc . )	1
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .	0
ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	1
battery life is good for a phone of this size .	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .	1
"warning ! . the windows "" remove program "" feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program ."	0
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .	1
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .	1
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .	1
fits well in hand in trouser pockets .	1
( it sure does look nice , though ! . ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge ! .	1
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .	1
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .	1
avoid this product at all costs .	0
great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .	1
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .	0
i was using the cheaper pail . . . and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .	1
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .	1
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .	1
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .	1
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .	1
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .	1
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .	1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .	0
this unit comes with the usb/firewire cable as a standard item now .	1
i think it 's great .	1
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .	1
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost/gb , and also consider ease of use .	1
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .	1
i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .	1
excellent diaper disposal unit .	1
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .	1
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .	0
"i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take ."	1
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .	1
it doesn 't bog down under load .	1
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .	1
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches .	0
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .	1
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .	0
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ! .	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .	1
i love this pail ! .	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .	0
6600 looks and feels nice .	1
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not .	0
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .	1
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device .	1
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .	0
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .	1
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .	1
the sound is incredible ; . very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast .	1
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .	1
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .	1
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .	1
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .	1
i love the touchpaper controls .	1
apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 ! .	0
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
it also does n 't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! . ! .	0
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .	1
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	1
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .	1
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .	1
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	1
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .	1
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small .	1
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .	1
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .	1
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .	1
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .	1
but those 2 come up every time .	0
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .	1
i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! .	1
i really love this phone . . .	1
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all .	1
pick your favorite color and buy it .	1
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .	1
it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed .	1
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .	1
"the bottom line is "" phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones "" ."	1
1 ) great audio quality overall .	1
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .	1
5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables .	1
- very long-lasting battery life	1
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .	1
2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .	1
they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides quality music at low prices .	1
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute .	1
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --	1
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .	1
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration .	1
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .	1
its not a perfect system but its a very good one .	1
i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70% of my 1 . 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed .	1
you 'll love it ! .	1
great camera , great investment ! .	1
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .	1
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .	1
"i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1/4 "" sleeve yet ) ."	1
i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .	1
can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .	1
10 great price for all the features .	1
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .	1
games -- not really important , but exist ant	1
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years .	1
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	0
tough as nails .	1
smooth plunging mechanism .	1
solid , squeak-free , large screen .	1
the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .	1
if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter .	1
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .	1
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .	1
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .	1
however , in my mind , $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months .	0
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .	1
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .	1
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .	1
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .	1
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .	1
power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .	1
installation was as near automatic as can be .	1
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .	1
i really liked the price . . .	1
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .	1
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	1
a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .	1
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important .	1
the volume .	0
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it .	1
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .	1
so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .	1
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .	1
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .	1
my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up .	0
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .	0
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .	1
"also , when i dial an "" 800 "" number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu ."	0
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .	1
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .	0
small size .	1
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .	1
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .	0
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .	1
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .	1
i did like the heft of the machine .	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .	1
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .	1
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .	1
- speakerphone	1
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .	1
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
they really are awfully small .	0
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .	0
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .	1
i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .	1
3 . bags are easy to change .	1
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying .	1
*the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily .	0
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .	1
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .	1
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version ! .	0
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .	1
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .	0
sound quality ? . phenomenal .	1
a sony erickson may be the phone for you . . . but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price .	1
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .	1
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over .	1
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .	1
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .	1
stay away from this product ! .	0
its also smaller , and gets more looks .	1
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong .	0
when talking the voice is not very clear .	0
yes , the features are numerous .	1
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys .	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .	1
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .	1
i like the automatic key lock function .	1
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .	1
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .	1
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .	1
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .	1
gets nice sound too .	1
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .	1
the radio feature has superb sound quality .	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .	1
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .	0
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design .	0
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .	1
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .	1
it is small .	1
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .	1
mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .	1
it also works just fine for international calls .	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .	0
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .	1
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .	1
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .	1
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .	1
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch .	1
they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all .	0
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .	0
"you can "" disable "" some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running ."	0
bottom line is that at $160 , this is an absolute steal .	1
*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .	1
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution .	1
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .	0
the interface works great .	1
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse .	0
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .	1
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38 ; . very convenient to scroll in menu etc .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	1
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .	1
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .	1
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of usb wires .	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .	1
it 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great .	1
i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the	1
unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable .	1
overall , i am very pleased with it .	1
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .	0
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .	1
"i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the "" very good "" range ( and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router ."	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .	1
i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .	1
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .	1
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .	1
this one is really great .	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	1
the radio and voice recording are nice .	1
speed is not a problem .	1
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .	0
the camera is adequate and if i want high-res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead .	1
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .	1
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .	1
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .	0
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .	1
1 . the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer .	1
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! .	1
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .	1
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i . e . organizer ) , and the radio ! .	1
color screen is good .	1
however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec .	0
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .	1
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .	1
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .	1
so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .	0
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .	1
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .	1
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; . cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price .	1
i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .	1
the gprs web access is slow ! .	0
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .	1
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .	0
this one has a good looking .	1
diaper champ is great .	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	0
firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .	1
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .	1
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )	1
the movie mode is also working great .	1
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc .	1
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .	1
the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .	1
as said before this works perfectly .	1
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .	1
